<h1>Retaining wall design</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Most urban developments incorporate basements, which are usually single
or double level (i.e. 3 to 6m deep) but can they have ten or more levels.
Basement construction is normally performed after installation of peripheral
retaining walls and subsequent excavation of the soils within the confines of
the walls. Popular walls employed for basement construction include 

<a href="sheet-pile.html">sheet-pile</a>,
<a href="secant-pile.html">secant pile</a>,
<a href="contiguous-pile.html ">contiguous pile</a>,
<a href="diaphragm-walls.html ">diaphragm walls</a>;

these walls are referred to as embedded walls as they transfer out of balance
forces through bending stiffness and differ from gravity retaining walls which
are not used ot construct basements in urban environments.</p>

<p>The removal/excavation o soil leeds to out-of-balance lateral soil stresses
( e.g. as the stress on the excavation side drops to zero). A new equilibrium
set of lateral soil stress acting on the inside and outside of hte wall is made
possible due to hte bending capacity of hte retaining wall. These streses
cannot be smaller than the active stress (which is not generally zero) and
cannot be larger than the pasive stress. <i>tThis laboratory experiment seeks
ot demonstrate the existence and reasons for these Active and Passive earth
pressure limits</i>.</p>

<p>The experement examines the simple case of vertical embedded wall supporting
a coarse grained soil. Two types of failure are simulated: (i) passive failure,
by driving the wall horizontally against the soil mass and (ii) active failure,
by withdrawing the wall by and equal amount at top and bottom. The experiment
is carried out on a sample of uniform dense sand, the properties of which are
given on the laboratory test sheet provided.</p>
