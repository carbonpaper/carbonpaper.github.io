    <h2>Where to start?</h2>
    <p>You won't want to wait long before considering to travel to Rottness or
    Rotto as we call it as places fill up fast. Luckily one of the best ways to
    experience the island is to camp there. This allows you to spend more time
    and money on activies which is where the most enjoyment is to be had</p>

    <p>You can purchase tickets from the following links and if you are an RAC
    member you get additional discounts on travelling to the island getaway!.
    There are many only a few options when it comes ot departing to the island
    but I recommend the trip from Fremantle. Not only is the trip shorter but
    you can grab a bite to eat from the historic town.</p>

    <h2>Reccomendations</h2>
    <h3>Transportation</h3>
    <p>Unless you are a cyclist and absolutely have to bring your own bike I
    would reccomend against it. The bike hire at Rottness is quite good and have
    a stronger preference towards the ebikes as they offer more of a moped like
    experience when compared to the regular pushbike.
    </p>

    <h3>Food and Drinks</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Frankies on Rotto</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Accommadation</h3>
    <p>Accomadation on the island can be quite espensive but with and difficult
    to book. I feel you get a better expereince camping on the island</p>

    <h3>Exploration</h3>
    <p>I think that the best places to check out on the island is the following</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Aquaplay hire</li>
        <li>Barefoot Bowls</li>
    </ul>
