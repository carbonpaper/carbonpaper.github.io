    <h2>Reccomendations</h2>
    <h3>Transportation</h3>
    <p>Unless you are a cyclist and absolutely have to bring your own bike I
    would reccomend against it. The bike hire at Rottness is quite good and have
    a stronger preference towards the ebikes as they offer more of a moped like
    experience when compared to the regular pushbike.
    </p>

    <h3>Food and Drinks</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Frankies on Rotto</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Accommadation</h3>
    <p>Accomadation on the island can be quite espensive but with and difficult
    to book. I feel you get a better expereince camping on the island</p>

    <h3>Exploration</h3>
    <p>I think that the best places to check out on the island is the following</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Aquaplay hire</li>
        <li>Barefoot Bowls</li>
    </ul>
